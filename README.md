Mobile application dataset having parameters such as date, date_from_install, color, impressions, clicks, revenue, and number of installs by user type to study the consumer behavior
The dataset under study is for mobile application having parameters such as date, date_from_install, color, impressions, clicks, revenue, and number of installs by user type from August 2014 to January 2015.
The main idea of this analysis is to study the consumer behavior and suggest data driven product growth strategy.
I have used Tableau for data preparation and visualization, Microsoft Excel to perform operation to calculate relevant metrics and forecast future numbers using pivot table and regression based forecast function.
We will be focusing on mainly two important metrics Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and Average Order Value (AOV).
